Comparison of For loop and While loop.

-> Initialization: 
	-> For loop - inside/outside of the loop
	-> While loop - outside of the loop

-> Increment/Decrement:
	-> For loop - after statement/s is/are executed
	-> While loop - before/after statement/s is/are executed

-> Itreation:
	-> For loop - used when number of iterations is known
	-> While loop - used when number of iterations is unknown

-> Conditions:
	-> For loop - relational expressions
	-> While loop - expression or non-zero value

-> Initialization/Increment/Decrement:
	-> For loop - used when initialization is easy
	-> While loop - used when initialization is complex

-> Similarity:
	-> Both are entry controlled loops.

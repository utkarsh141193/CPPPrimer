Difference between int, long and short: 

1: size:
	short : half a machine word (16 bits)
	int : a machine word (32 bits)
	long : 1 or 2 machine words (64 bits)

	*Note: For some machines int/long occupies same space

2: depends on machine to machine:
	The only guarantee in size of short <= size of long

3: values and ranges:
	short signed integer (16 bits in size) - [-32768, 32767]
	long signed integer (32 bits in size) - [-2147483648, 2147483647]

4: for unsigned values and ranges: 
	short unsigned integer (16 bits) - [0, 65535]
	long unsigned integer (32 bits) - [0, 4294967295]
